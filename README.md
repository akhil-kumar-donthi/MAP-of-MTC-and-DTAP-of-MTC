# MAP-of-MTC-and-DTAP-of-MTC
Mobile Application Projects

To Readers or Evaluators,

My name is Akhil and I am a Software Developer. By using Java, BI and UI technologies
I can develop both Web and Desktop based Applications and Tools. 
I am a Web Application Developer. I don't know developing Mobile Applications. 
So This project don't have any code. 

I hope these Innovations are leads towards Digital India.
This project is related to Government of India and World too.
If my thesis is feasible in both Technically and Practically. 
Then I would like to be part of the Development team.


Both Applications are exclusively for MTC: Metropolitan Transport Corporations.

1) DTAP: Digital Ticket Application for Passengers.
2) MAP: Monitoring Applications for Passengers.

DTAP is suitable to any Metropolitan Transport Corporation. 
But where as MAP is depends on MTC Management and its Infrastructure.

Both Applications are 80% based on Mobile Technologies. For more details 
please refer attached Documentation in this Project.

As a Software Developer To develop both Applications at least it takes 
around 4 to 6 Months. For only DTAP it might be done in 2 to 3 Months.

If you have any queries please contact me.

Thanks

Akhil
